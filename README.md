This is just a simple collection of the scripts that I use to manage my music collection. With these examples that include usage of the tinytag and mutagen libraries, you can:
- identify duplicate files in your collection
- add missing genre and artist tags
- archive files to different target folders by artist name
- bulk rename files based on artist and title tags
- generate reports that identify which genres are most heavily represented in your music collection
